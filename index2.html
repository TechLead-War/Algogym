											<h2>Question 2:</h2>
										</header>
										<p><font face="Calibri" size="+2"><i>
										There are N provinces [1. 2... N]. King Bob wants to create his kingdom. For this, he needs to capture some provinces. Two provinces can be connected by water, land, or by both. A pair of provinces are connected by land and B pairs of provinces are connected by water. Since bob's navy is very weak, he does not want any of his captured provinces to be connected by water, moreover. Bob has a strong army, so he wants to capture every province that is connected to his kingdom by land.
										<br><br>
More formally, the following conditions must be satisfied:<br>

• For each captured province every province connected to it by land should also be captured.<br>

• No two provinces captured should be connected by water directly or by any other provinces.
<br>
• Any two captured provinces should be connected directly or through other captured provinces.<br>
<br>
<b>Task</b>
<br>
Output the maximum number of provinces that Bob can capture satisfying the given conditions. If bob can't capture any province then output 0.
<br>
<b>Example</b>
<br><br>
<b>Assumptions</b>
<br>
• T=1<br>
• N=5<br>
• A=2<br>
• B=1<br>
• land = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]<br>

• water = [[1, 3]]<br>
<br>
<b>Approach</b><br>

• Province 1 is connected to province 2 by land, province 1 is connected to province 3 by water, and province 2 is connected to 3 by land.
<br>
Following provinces can be captured [4], [5].<br>
Group of provinces [1, 2, 3] can't be captured because 1 and 3 are connected by water.
<br>
Therefore the minimum number of provinces that can be captured is 1.<br>
<br>
<b>Function description</b><br>

Complete the function solve() provided in the editor. This function takes the following five parameters and returns the required answer:<br>

• N. Represents the number of provinces<br>

• A: Represents the number of provinces connected by land
<br>
• B. Represents the number of provinces connected by water.<br> 
• land[A][2] land[i][0] and land[1][1] represent that these provinces are connected by land.<br>

• water[B][2] water[i][0] and water[i][1] represent that these provinces are connected by water. <br>
<br>
<b>Input format</b><br>
<b>Note</b>: This is the input format that you must use to provide customi Input (available above the Compile and Test button).<br>

The first line contains T, the number of test cases. T also specifies the number of times you have to run the solve function on a different set of inputs.<br>

. For each test case:<br>

The first line contains N, the number of provinces.
<br>
The second line contains A, the number of pairs of provinces connected by land.
<br>
The third line contains B, the number of pairs of provinces connected by water.
<br>
The next A lines contain two space-separated integers i.e. two provinces connected by land. The next B lines contain two space-separated integers i.e. two provinces connected by water.<br>
<br>
<b>Output format</b><br>

For each test case in a new line. print the answer.
<br><br>
<b>Constraints</b><br>
1≤T≤ 100<br>

1 ≤ N ≤105 0≤A+B≤N
<br>
1 ≤ land[i], water[i] < N<br>

A, B≥ 0

1<br>
5<br>

1 3 <br>
3 2<br>

Output: <br>
1<br>

<br>
<b>Explanation</b><br>

The first line contains the number of test cases, T=1.<br>

The first test case<br>

Given<br>

•T=1<br>

• N=5<br>

• A=2<br>

• B=1<br>

• land = [[1, 2]]<br>

• water = [[1, 3], [3,2]]<br>
<br><br>
<b>Approach</b><br>

• Province 1 is connected to province 2 by land and province 1 is connected to province 3 by water and province 3 is connected to province 2 by water.<br>

The maximum group of provinces connected by land is 2 ie, [1, 2] by since province 1 is connected to province 3 by water and province 3 is connected to province 2 by water, therefore provinces 1 and 2 are indirectly connected by water, therefore we can't take this group.<br>
Therefore the maximum number of provinces that can be captured is 1. [3] [4] [5] .<br>
